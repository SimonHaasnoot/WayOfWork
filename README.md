# Way Of Work
## Introduction
At Macaw we standardized our way of working where we strive for code quality, readability and quick project onboarding. This document will help you, the awesome Macaw employee, get up to speed and teach you in understanding our **way of work**.

## Editor
We work with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is possible to use a different editor, but we highly recommend using this one (some extensions might for example not be available). This will make it easier for colleagues to help out if necessary.

## Extensions
Within Visual Studio Code we use a set of extensions where some are **required** for our code quality, productivity, formatting and testability.
